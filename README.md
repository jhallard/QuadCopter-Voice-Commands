QuadCopter-Voice-Commands
=========================

This project uses the open source language processing toolbox from Carnegie Mellon University to process voice commands, parse them through a defined grammar and send them off to a quadcopter. The Quadcopter control commands are not in this project, this is simply the voice interface.
